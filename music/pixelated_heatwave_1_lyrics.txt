[Verse]
The screen lights up with a neon flash
Here comes the missiles aimed to clash
Explosions dance like fireworks in disguise
In the chaos I see my name in the skies

[Chorus]
Boom boom goes the pixel parade
Virtual war games in patterns displayed
Defend the cities don’t let them fall
I’m the last line of code standing tall

[Verse 2]
Joystick trembles in my sweaty palm
The end of the world but I stay calm
Press the button watch rockets scream
It’s just me and fate against the machine

[Chorus]
Boom boom goes the pixel parade
Virtual war games in patterns displayed
Defend the cities don’t let them fall
I’m the last line of code standing tall

[Bridge]
Radioactive clouds in digital air
Every move feels like a dare
Missiles explode my time runs thin
But losing’s just another way to begin

[Chorus]
Boom boom goes the pixel parade
Virtual war games in patterns displayed
Defend the cities don’t let them fall
I’m the last line of code standing tall
